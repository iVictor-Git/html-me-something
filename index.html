                            I started coding back in high school around 2011 when I was in this basic
                            computer class, I can't even remember the name of it, but I think it was 
                            Intro to Photoshop. While it was a class for Photoshop, the teacher gave us
                            an assignment, to pair up with another in class and make a website. 
                        </p>

                    <div class="main-flex-items">
                        <p class="section">
                            It was at that time, that I was took my first crack at coding, predominately
                            HTML5 and some CSS3. I was a total newbie. We had actually decided to do a
                            movie review site. My responsibility was creating the pages and my partner was
                            in charge of providing the content. Wasn't the best site, but hey, first attempt
                            at coding so I got some experience with it.

                        <p class="section">
                            Well, after that class, I ended up not really pursuing coding, until I entered college
                            in 2014 (took a hiatus from school in 2013). It was in that year that I took a class
                            in Python, called Intro to Python. The book assigned for reading taught me some basics,
                            like different data types, variables, functions, etc, but there was so much information
                            that it was overloading me. I was also taking Intro to Java at the same time, so
                            I was basically learning 2 languages at the same time (probably shouldn't have done that).
                            In any event, these were taught at the college (SPC), and I felt like I still didn't learn much.

                            Unsatisfied, I actually looked for resources online, and found Codecademy. It cemented some principles
                            that I couldn't quite get and I had a better understanding of Python. I even learned OOP as well, but there were
                            some concepts that eluded me. I had stopped learning Python after that, this was in around 2015. 
                            Thanks in part to LaunchCode 2017, I'm pretty comfortable in Python, and the concepts that were giving me trouble,
                            dictionaries and tuples, are no longer vague concepts.

                            I don't intend to just know HTML5, CSS3, and Python. I plan to learn it all and become a Full-stack developer,
                            I eventually will go into AI because I want to one day make a home system, run by AI. That's as far as I'm willing
                            to share regarding that.
